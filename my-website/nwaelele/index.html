                Where the norm is to be shaddy, dishonest and do whatever it takes to be a success,
                this man chooses to follow the saviour, stay true to his christians virtues and yet
                became a success. He is a testament that both secular and eternal goals or achievement
                can be accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is willing to do the harder right right rather than the easier wrong. He prioritizes
                his family before any financial or temporary success. To him, his family is the most 
                important thing to him and he will rather win as a husband, father and brother than as a
                business man.
            </p>
            <p>
                He personally does not believe that poverty is a good thing. He believes that he can be
                saved both eternally and temporally and by temporally, it's salvation from poverty and a 
                very difficult life.
                <img src="images/icon-poor.jpg" alt="poor people">To achieve this, he went to school and graduated as a certified
                accountant, serve a full time mission and remain faithful to the covenant that he made
                with God. The knowledge gained from the scriptures and other good books and experiences
                taught him vital lessons and became the anchor of his foundation upon which he built successful
                businesses that helped him defeat poverty.
